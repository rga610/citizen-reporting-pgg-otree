        <p>
            Welcome to this experiment on citizen reporting. In this study, you will take on the role of a <strong>citizen</strong> 
            in a community where public infrastructure (such as roads, bridges, streetlights, etc.) may need maintenance or repair.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As a citizen, you have the opportunity to contribute to a <strong>public good</strong> by reporting faulty or 
            damaged public infrastructure. Your contributions help improve the overall quality of public infrastructure 
            in your community, which benefits everyone.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The experiment will proceed in multiple rounds. In each round, you will decide how much to contribute 
            to reporting public infrastructure issues. The decisions you make will affect both your own outcomes 
            and the outcomes of other participants in your group.
        </p>
