        How the Experiment Works
    </h3>

    <h5>Group Structure</h5>
    <p>
        You will be randomly assigned to a group of <strong>{{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants</strong>. 
        Each participant in your group represents a citizen in the same community.
    </p>

    <h5>Your Endowment</h5>
    <p>
        At the start of each round, you will receive <strong>{{ Constants.endowment }} points</strong>. 
        These points represent resources (time, effort, or tokens) that you can use to report faulty 
        public infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h5>Your Decision</h5>
    <p>
        In each round, you decide how much to contribute to reporting public infrastructure issues. 
        You can contribute any amount from <strong>0 to {{ Constants.endowment }}</strong> points. 
        The points you do not contribute, you keep for yourself.
    </p>

    <h5>How Earnings Are Calculated</h5>
    <p>
        The experiment works as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>All contributions from your group members are added together to get the <strong>total contribution</strong>.</li>
        <li>This total is multiplied by a factor of <strong>{{ Constants.multiplier }}</strong> to determine the 
            <strong>total value of the public good</strong> (improved infrastructure reporting).</li>
        <li>This total value is then <strong>divided equally</strong> among all {{ Constants.players_per_group }} 
            participants in your group, regardless of how much each person contributed.</li>
        <li>Your final payoff for the round equals:
            <ul>
                <li>The points you kept ({{ Constants.endowment }} - your contribution), <strong>plus</strong></li>
                <li>Your equal share of the public good value</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Example</h5>
    <p>
        Suppose you contribute 50 points, and the other participants in your group 
        also contribute 50 points each. The total contribution would be 
        {{ Constants.players_per_group }} × 50 points. 
        This is multiplied by {{ Constants.multiplier }} to determine the total public good value. 
        This total value is then divided equally among all {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants. 
        Your payoff equals the points you kept ({{ Constants.endowment }} - 50) plus your equal share of the public good.
    </p>

    <h5>Multiple Rounds</h5>
    <p>
        The experiment consists of <strong>{{ Constants.num_rounds }} rounds</strong>. In each round, you will make 
        the same decision. Your group composition will remain the same throughout all rounds. 
        Your final payment will be based on your total earnings across all rounds.
